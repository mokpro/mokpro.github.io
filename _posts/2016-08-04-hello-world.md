This is my first post on my very own website. Exciting!

Story so far:
  - Bought a domain name on [Namespace][namespace-home]
  - Hosted a [Sinatra][sinatra-home] app on [Heroku][heroku-home]
  - Moved the web page to [GitHub Pages][github-pages], built with [Jekyll][jekyll-home]
  - Added blogs/notes feature.


Will be right back with detailed `notes`.
